# Don't check for nil, let it panic

In Go, when you assign a typed nil value to an interface, the interface will not be equal to nil.
Let's start with a simple example and create a simple interface:
```go
type Sender interface {
	Send(message string) error
}
```
And an `EmailSender` which implements `Sender`:
```go
type EmailSender struct {
	FromAddress string
}

func (es *EmailSender) Send(message string) error {
	fmt.Printf("sending email from %v", es.FromAddress)
	return nil
}
```
And an `SMSSender` implementation:
```go
type  SMSSender  struct {
	FromAddress string
}

func (sms *SMSSender) Send(message string) error {
	fmt.Printf("sending sms from %v", sms.FromAddress)
	return  nil
}
```
We also have a function that accepts the interface as an argument:
```go
func SendMessage(sender Sender, message string) error {
	if sender == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
	}
	return sender.Send(message)
}
```
All is good, until we call our function with a nil value:
```go
func main() {
	var sender *EmailSender
	// this call will panic
	SendMessage(sender, "hello world!")
}
```
The `SendMessage` function calls the `Send` method which causes the program to panic when accessing `FromAddress` on the nil `sender`. But why hasn't the function returned right away in the `if sender == nil` check?

This is a common pitfall for new Go developers [especially when dealing with errors](https://go.dev/doc/faq#nil_error). The reason for this behavior is, that an interface value will equal to nil only when the underlying type *and* value are both equal to nil. In the above example, since the value of `sender` does have a type `*EmailSender`, even though the value is nil, it will not be considered equal to nil.

## How can I ensure that the value of an interface is not nil?
At this point, a question arises. We should aim for robust code where we handle errors gracefully. We try to avoid runtime panics at all costs, is there a way to guard our `SendMessage` function and check whether the value of `sender` is nil or not, so it doesn't blow up? Let's explore our options.

## Using type assertion
We can solve this problem by using type assertions:
```go
if sender == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
}
if t, ok := sender.(*EmailSender); ok && t == nil {
	return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
}
if t, ok := sender.(*SMSSender); ok && t == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
}
```
This works, but it's very verbose and tedius to write. Can we simplify these checks with a type switch?

## Type switch
Let's try to simplify it with a simple switch statement:
```go
switch v := sender.(type) {
case (*EmailSender):
	if v == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
	}
case (*SMSSender):
	if v == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
	}
case nil:
	return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
}
```
Works as well but even more verbose. While the previous version was 9 lines of code, this version has 12 lines. Furtunately, we can group many switch cases in a single line:
```go
switch v := sender.(type) {
case (*EmailSender), (*SMSSender), nil:
	if v == nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
	}
}
```
I was surprised to get the following result: `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`. The check now returns false! Why is that? It turnes out that this is the expected behaviour of grouped cases in a type switch. The [language specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_switches) clearly states it:

> In clauses with a case listing exactly one type, the variable has that type; otherwise, the variable has the type of the expression in the TypeSwitchGuard".

In other words, in our first example, the case clause had just a single case so the value of `v` had the type of that case, enabling our typed nil check. But in the second example, sice we had multiple types in the case, the valie of `v` was of type `Sender` so checking `v == nil` was nil as we saw when we started, that interfaces are nil only when thy have no underlying type.

Type assertion won't do the job for us. Let's try something different.
## Comparing with typed nil values
We can use a regular [comparison check](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Comparison_operators) to check if our value is nil:
```go
if sender == nil || sender == (*EmailSender)(nil) {
	return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
}
```
And luckily, we can beutifully simplify this approach with a simple switch statement:

```go
switch sender {
case (*EmailSender)(nil), (*SMSSender)(nil), nil:
	return fmt.Errorf("sender is nil")
}
```
This is a nice and clean solution and *could* have worked if the `SendMessage` function would have be unexported, preventing our library consumers from calling it with yet another implementation. However, since our function is exported, users can pass any type which satisfies `Sender` and we have no way of knowing beforehand which type `sender` will be. This makes our solution practically useless.

## Having the nil check as part of the interface contract

I have seen people suggest that we solve this by updating our interface definition to include a method which checks for nil.
```go
type Sender interface {
	Send(message string) error
	IsNil() bool
}
```
Now have each implementation tell us whether it is nil or not. For example, our `EmailSender` will now need to add a method.
```go
func (es *EmailSender) IsNil() bool {
	return es == nil
}
```
and we can simply check
```go
if sender == nil || sender.IsNil() {
	fmt.Printf("sender is nil")
	return
}
```
Don't do this, it is unidiomatic and doesn't make any sense when you think about it. An interface should describe just the functionality of what it is capable of doing and nothing else. Nil checking is not part of the functionality you expect from a message sender and nil checking is an internal implementation detail.
Let's try something else.

## Reaching for reflection
We can reach to the reflect package to help us solve our problem.
```go
if sender == nil || reflect.ValueOf(sender).IsNil() {
	fmt.Printf("sender is nil")
	return
}
```
The above check will work most of the time, but most of the time is not enough. The check itself may panic if the value of `sender` is a value and not a pointer. To see this in action, just change the method receiver of `SMSSender.Send` to a value instead of a pointer:
```go
func (sms SMSSender) Send(message string) error {
	fmt.Printf("sending sms from %v", sms.FromAddress)
	return  nil
}
```
Now when you call `SendMessage(smsSender)`, the call panics as [`IsNil`](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#Value.IsNil) may only be called on types chan, func, interface, map, pointer, or slice value. We can fix this with yet another reflect function to ensure we call `IsNil` for valid values only.
```go
if sender == nil {
	fmt.Printf("sender is nil")
	return
}
switch  v := reflect.ValueOf(sender); v.Kind() {
case reflect.Ptr, reflect.Map, reflect.Chan, reflect.Slice, reflect.Func:
	if v.IsNil() {
		fmt.Printf("sender is nil")
		return
	}
}
```
Note, there is no need to check for `reflect.Interface` in our case, as it's impossible for the `sender` value to be an interface type. This is due to the fact that a method receiver [cannot be an interface](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Comparison_operators:~:text=nor%20an%20interface).

This solution *should* work. It's kind of ugly to deal with reflection and [reflection is never clear](https://go-proverbs.github.io/#:~:text=Reflection%20is%20never%20clear), but it seems to be the only proper solution.
But, let's step back a second.

## Are nil values dangerous?
Go allows us to call methods on nil pointers, so let us update our interface implementation so it checks if the receiver is nil, and if it is, it uses a default value instead of accessing it.
```go
type  EmailSender  struct {
	FromAddress string
}
func (es *EmailSender) Send(message string) error {
	addr := "default address"
	if es != nil {
		addr = es.FromAddress
	}
	fmt.Printf("sending email from %v", addr)
	return  nil
}
```
Now we can safely pass our nil `EmailSender` to the `SendMessage` function. It won't panic, and it will fall back to the default predefined behavior. Now should you reject nil inputs? Of course not! Nil values are perfectly valid and they can be a handy technique in your toolbox.

What about nil interfaces, should you check `if sender == nil`? Calling `Send` on a nil `Sender` will panic after all. Let's check the standard library for inspiration.

## How the standard library handles nil interfaces
The Go standard library defines [quite a few interfaces](https://sweetohm.net/article/go-interfaces.en.html). Let's see the [`fs.ReadDir`](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#ReadDir) function which requires an [`io.FS`](https://pkg.go.dev/io/fs#FS) as its first argument. If you run `fs.ReadDir(nil, "")` you get `panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`. This function does not do any nil check on its argument. Why is that, isn't it a good practice to validate our inputs to avoid runtime errors?

## It is up to the caller
When you call a function that accepts a pointer or an interface, unless otherwise documented, you should assume by default that passing nil to it will cause a panic. A function may explicitly support nil values, but it must be clearly documented. For example, the [`http.ListenAndServe`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ListenAndServe) function documents its behavior as follows: `The handler is typically nil, in which case the DefaultServeMux is used`.
So when a user passes nil to our function the panic is no problem, it's the callers problem. The best way to handle it is by panicing and letting them know that they used it incorrectly. That's what panics are for, and I would argue that sprinkling your entire codebase with unnecessary nil checks harms readability and is a bad code smell.

As a side note, the same rule applies to method receivers. Don't check your receivers for nil out of fear that someone *accidentally* forgot to initialize them. Unless you explicitly support it, it is up to the caller to ensure that the value is not nil.

### I am still not convinced, mistakes happen, and I want to prevent panics at all costs
If the user is not careful and introduces bugs in their code, you may still cause a panic when calling their interface implementation even if you do check for nils. There may be plenty of other internal problems causing the runtime to blow up. For example, the method may internally try to access a method on a nil field on the struct, or do some other thing that may cause the runtime to error out. You can never account for all cases. All you should do is trust your user in these cases, and the panic will let them know if the made a mistake in their code.
